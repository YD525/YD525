## Hi there 👋,I’m YD525(约定).
The term YD is actually an abbreviation using the first letters of the Pinyin spelling: YueDing -> YD.

525 is actually a set of important numbers that I will never forget.

Uh oh, I think I said a bunch of useless things, didn't I? Please don't mind it. QAQ.

I love Japan, Germany, the United States, and all the countries in the world!

I really wish I could work on a project with programmers from all over the world.

I’m the type to wag my tail and please others—if you find mistakes, I’ll fix them~

I’m passionate about 2D culture, and my creations come from my emotions. When I’m in a good state, I work very hard; when I’m not, progress slows down or sometimes I just put things aside.

I like having a following, but I don’t blindly chase popularity—I only create what I truly want to.

—I don’t follow the world. I build my own.

I love chatting, so I tend to talk a lot and get a bit wordy—hope you don’t mind.

Also... I really wanna be famous, ahhhhh!

(Oh wait, forget I said that. I never said it.)
