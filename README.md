# 👋 Hi, I’m YD525 (约定)

## ✨ About My Name
YD comes from the initials of the Pinyin YueDing.
525 is a set of numbers that carries a special meaning to me—something I’ll never forget.

## 💫 Who I Am
🐾 I'm the type who happily wags my tail—if you spot mistakes, I’ll fix them right away.
🎨 I’m passionate about 2D culture, and my creativity is closely tied to my emotions.
When I'm in a good state, I work extremely hard.
When I’m not, progress slows down—or I may set things aside for a while.
⭐ I enjoy having people follow my work, but I never chase popularity blindly.
I create only what I truly want to create.
🧩 I don’t follow the world. I build my own.

## 🔧 What I Work On
- C/S C# WPF C++ MFC,KMDF C# WinForm,B/S C# ASP.Net MVC C# NetCore MVC
- (My WPF layering might not be the standard MVVM, but rather a type I prefer.)
- Favorite language: C# / C++
- Papyrus,Jass,Lua (I'm a beginner, so my writing might not be very good.)
- Tools, utilities, mods, and passion-driven projects
- I value logic, iteration, and long-term craftsmanship over shortcuts



If you think my work is not bad, please consider giving it a Star ⭐ as a small gesture of support.
