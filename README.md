👋 Hi, I’m YD525 (约定)

✨ **About My Name**  
YD comes from the initials of the Pinyin YueDing. 525 is a set of numbers that carries a special meaning to me—something I’ll never forget.

💫 **Who I Am**  
🐾 I happily wag my tail when coding—spot a mistake, and I’ll fix it right away.  
🎨 Passionate about 2D culture, my creativity follows my emotions.  
⭐ I enjoy people following my work, but I never chase popularity blindly. I create only what I truly want to create.  
🧩 I don’t follow the world. I build my own.

🔧 **What I Work On**  
**Languages & Frameworks:**  
- C# (WPF, WinForms, ASP.Net MVC, NetCore MVC)  
- C++ (MFC, KMDF)  
- Papyrus / Jass / Lua (beginner)

**Focus Areas:**  
- Tools, utilities, mods  
- Logic, iteration, and long-term craftsmanship  

If you like my work, consider giving it a ⭐ as a small gesture of support.
