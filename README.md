## Hi there 👋,I am YD525(约定).
The term YD is actually an abbreviation using the first letters of the Pinyin spelling: YueDing -> YD.

525 is actually a set of important numbers that I will never forget.

Uh oh, I think I said a bunch of useless things, didn't I? Please don't mind it. QAQ.

I love Japan, Germany, the United States, and all the countries in the world!
I really wish I could work on a project with programmers from all over the world.
